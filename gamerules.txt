STANFORD LOGIC

Object:
  Know the number and suit of all 24 cards on the table before the opponent team

Materials:
  • 2 decks of cards (with different colored backs)
  • Exactly 4 players
  • Table with four sides

Setup:
  • Choose a partner, and sit across the table from them
  • Take all of the spades out of one deck and remove the king
  • Take all of the diamonds out of the other deck and remove the king
  • Shuffle the resulting spades and diamonds from the two decks
  • Deal 6 cards to each person face down
  • Everyone can look at their own cards
  • Order cards from least to greatest, left to right, with ace lowest and queen highest, still face down
  • The youngest player starts

Rules:
  • When it is your turn, you may ask your partner to slide you ONE of his/her cards to see, but DO NOT LET ANYONE ELSE SEE
  • Give the card back to your partner
  • Now you may guess any of your opponents cards by pointing and saying the number (from either opponent), and if you are
    correct, they must flip over the card you guessed
  • Turn moves clockwise
  • At any point when it is your turn, you may choose to end the game and try to name every card on the table.  Cards are to
    be flipped over as you guess them, and if you guess incorrectly at any point, your team loses.  But if you guess all
    cards correctly, your team wins!
